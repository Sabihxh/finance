## Trading Strategies

This project aims to find the most profitable mid-term trading strategies for FTSE 350 stocks. The best trading strategies would be the ones that can shortlist (1-10) the best stocks to invest in and also give information on when to close the trade. The trading strategy could consist of several trading stratgies which work together to shortlist the stocks.

The jupyter notebook `strategies.ipynb` contains the mock up of trading strategies. 

The `data_stocks` directory contains data for all FTSE 350 companies starting from 2014-01-01.

### To do
- Use google storage
- Move trading strategies from notebook to .py module
- Get data going back as early as possible for all stocks instead of 2014-01-01
- Write tests
- Implement more strategies (use zipline?)
- Backtest all strategies
