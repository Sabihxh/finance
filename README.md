## Trading Strategies

This project aims to find an algorithm that can shortlist the best companies to invest in on FTSE 350 index. The algorithm would consist of several mid to long term trading strategies which work together to shortlist the stocks.

The jupyter notebook `strategies.ipynb` contains the mock up of trading strategies. 

The `data_stocks` directory contains data for all FTSE 350 companies starting from 2014-01-01.

### To do:
- Use google storage instead of csv files
- Create the basic algorithm
- Move trading strategies from notebook to .py module
- Get data going back as early as possible for all stocks instead of 2014-01-01
- Implement more strategies (use zipline?)
- Backtest all strategies
- Write tests
