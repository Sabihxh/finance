# Tridex
Algorithm consisting of multiple mid and long term trading strategies that shortlist the best companies to invest in on FTSE 350 index, on a given day.

The jupyter notebook `strategies.ipynb` contains the mock up of trading strategies. 

The `data_stocks` directory contains data for all FTSE 350 companies starting from 2014-01-01.

## Trading Strategies
In progress

### To do:
- Use google storage instead of csv files
- Create the basic algorithm
- Move trading strategies from notebook to .py module
- Get data going back as early as possible for all stocks instead of 2014-01-01
- Implement more strategies (use zipline?)
- Backtest all strategies
- Write tests
