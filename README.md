##Â Trading Strategies

This project aims to implement trading strategies and test them on FTSE 350 stocks. 

The jupyter notebook **strategies.ipynb** contains the mock up of trading strategies. 

The data_stocks directory contains data for all FTSE 350 companies starting from 2014-01-01.

**To do:**
- Move trading strategies from notebook to .py module
- Get data going back as early as possible for all stocks instead of 2014-01-01
- Write tests
- Implement more strategies
- Use google storage for data
