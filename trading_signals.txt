RSI: The RSI (Relative Strength Indicator) is an oscillator that ranges from zero to 100. A low-number reading suggests a stock is oversold and ready to bounce. A typical buy level for this indicator is 30. Because stocks can stay oversold for an extended period of time, the buy signal is defined as when the RSI goes from below 30 to above 30. In other words, it was oversold and now heading upward.
MACD: The MACD (Moving Average Convergence/Divergence) is calculated using the difference in two moving averages for a stock. A moving average of that difference is then used and called the signal line. A common buy signal is generated when the MACD crosses above that signal line.
Golden Cross: A golden cross is when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average. In the analysis below, I used a 50-day and 200-day moving average.
Moving Average Crossover: This is simply looking at the stock price crossing above a certain moving average. I compared returns after the price crossed above the 50- and 200-day moving averages.
Bollinger Bands: These use a moving average, and then bands are placed two standard deviations above and below the moving average. When the stock price touches the lower band, it is often considered oversold and a bounce in the stock price is expected.
Moving Average Pullbacks: For a stock on the rise, some traders might wait for a pullback to enter the position. One popular way to define a pullback -- which is then a buy signal -- is when the stock falls to within a range of a rising moving average. I consider pullbacks to the 50-day and 200-day moving average.
